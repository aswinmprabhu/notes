CAP Theorem  
  

The CAP theorem states that a system can guarantee only 2 of the following 3:

- **Consistency** - **Reads receive the most recent write.**
- **Availability** - **All requests succeed, no matter the failures.**
- **Partition Tolerance** - **The system continues to operate despite dropped / delayed messages between nodes.**
