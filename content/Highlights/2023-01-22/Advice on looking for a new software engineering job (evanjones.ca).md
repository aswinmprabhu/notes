## Highlights

> first task is to figure out more precisely what I want. You might already know, but making time to think about it helps me understand what I'm looking for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#b8bf5551-8227-4fcc-af34-faeae6748a58)  ^b8bf5551

> The most important part is to end up with something that will make you happy, not something that impresses your friends or family. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#a7bef029-1625-4f14-a680-335e348268ad)  ^a7bef029

> One thing I have found useful is to cast a wide net at the beginning of the process, and talk to many friends and acquaintances about what they are working on. Having these conversations helps me understand what things I find exciting, and what things I don't. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#17ecdd6e-8066-4f2b-ad9a-783cdefcc113)  ^17ecdd6e

> After you have some ideas about what you are looking for, you should reach out to anyone who might be able to refer you to any company. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#43cd762b-3bc7-4030-bd23-9444362cbb51)  ^43cd762b

> Get at least 2-3 offers, so apply to approximately 10 places [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#0c830abc-497a-453c-9955-abd5b9b3327b)  ^0c830abc

> Improve your resume [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#275ee1f3-8b92-4d29-ba5d-532ffbb8bc3d)  ^275ee1f3

> Get someone who works at a different company to proofread it. This helps ensure you do not include company-specific details. You must avoid typos or grammar errors.
> Ensure you can talk about anything in more detail. People will ask you about random bullet points from your resume. Don't include things you don't want to discuss.
> Describe your specific work, and the impact of why it mattered. For example, don't just say "lowered page loading time," but include "unblocking a new video previews feature".
> Include specific numbers, where possible. This makes it seem more real, and communicates the scale of impact. For example, instead of "lowered page loading time", say "reduced median page load time from 1s to 100ms". [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#d1ea8108-56bb-41bc-b6c1-3c2890f3834a)  ^d1ea8108

> Order your interviews from least to most desirable [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#2eac5a3c-bb3c-4d97-9907-927ff5528539)  ^2eac5a3c

> You should interview with the companies you are the least interested in first, so you can practice on ones that matter less. Like all skills, you will get better at interviews as you do them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#e2b49bf3-8d6b-4ffc-9dc2-13da02a78cff)  ^e2b49bf3

> Prepare for your interviews [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#81dec4f6-a25e-43b7-a911-d71315d1b820)  ^81dec4f6

> It is hard work, but the hours you spend preparing will pay off over multiple years, by allowing you to get a job you want, and to be compensated better. It is probably one of the highest leverage activities for accelerating your career. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#3189fb46-0ef8-4652-b8cb-623ab0e4fb7c)  ^3189fb46

> Negotiate your offer [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#a29160b9-943a-45c8-a455-75af1d15645d)  ^a29160b9

> Get multiple offers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#ed2a9230-cff2-45f3-83ba-14ea254b2082)  ^ed2a9230

> Be respectful and polite to everyone you talk to, and don't lie. I have heard of offers being rescinded after people are rude or who misrepresent the facts while negotiating. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#5f379533-f9ce-4aea-aeb0-89892631e35c)  ^5f379533

> I do not talk about my salary expectations, except in vague terms. Recruiters and employers negotiate job offers every day. I do it once every 4 or 5 years at most. They have a lot more information and practice. To help level the playing field, I want them to make their initial best offer [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#f461874f-dd67-42cd-a394-b32a4e126417)  ^f461874f

> I have provided vague guidance like "I expect the salary to be competitive with large publicly traded software companies" to ensure neither of us wastes time with an interview if that is not going to be possible. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#88ca6c39-17a3-4f0b-a145-1d136fcb5c4a)  ^88ca6c39

> When being told an offer details, I do not discuss my reaction. I take notes, I ask questions to clarify the details, and then tell the recruiter I need to think about it. I want time to think about how to negotiate the offer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#e2a640c3-dabf-4e6b-b8c8-a05f2c2c483d)  ^e2a640c3

> If you have multiple offers, I suggest asking every other employer if they can beat it. Tell the company that made the best offer that they have the best offer, but you are waiting for others to make counter-offers. Sometimes this will cause them to preemptively increase their offer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#9fea88dc-bd76-4a2c-8b4b-6b64b8178404)  ^9fea88dc

> Consider trading one form of compensation for another, to fine tune your best offer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#0116f08b-de73-4b12-a0e5-6a1a3f552eb6)  ^0116f08b

> At most software companies, base salary is constrained to a "band" by the "level" you are being hired at. It is very rare that a recruiter or hiring manager can adjust your starting salary outside of that band. However, signing bonus and stock packages tend to be less constrained, so you may have more ability to negotiate for those. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#2f870833-097a-49c7-95c5-a49652bace8d)  ^2f870833

> One strategy I like is once you get your preferred employer close to what you want, you can tell them "If you change X, I will agree to the offer immediately." [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#3508702a-f359-4c84-a0da-4084f0094da3)  ^3508702a

> Specific Interview Advice: Coding [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#76af6280-0b35-43da-8f0a-5439b4e91ecc)  ^76af6280

> I start by asking clarifying questions, to ensure I understand the problem. Next, I write a basic example or two, if they are not provided. This can catch miscommunications early. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#79884a17-1058-46d1-bf77-136b9db0076e)  ^79884a17

> After I understand the problem, I describe my high level approach, and confirm that it sounds acceptable with the interviewer. Often, they will guide you towards a "better" solution if you are close but not on quite the right track. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#cdabdfe1-9a9d-4806-9263-aeeac4e4b611)  ^cdabdfe1

> My approach is to literally say "I'm going to start with the simplest thing I can think of, even though this is probably not optimal." I try not to waste time thinking about "smarter" algorithmic approaches. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#02f5c4d0-4406-40bf-bdee-8c77998f2834)  ^02f5c4d0

> If you are using a computer, ask your interviewer if you can search for documentation or examples. Some will allow it, some will not. Run your code incrementally as you write it, rather than waiting until the end when you need to fix a large pile of typos and compiler errors. Finally, if you are using your own computer, come prepared with a project pre-configured in your favourite IDE [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#58c30d07-fb5f-4d7f-aa62-7c7815ba87ad)  ^58c30d07

> Bring your computer with a project pre-configured in your favourite IDE, ideally with an "empty" unit test. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#31c93419-2a85-465d-a9e3-246041e803a3)  ^31c93419

> I think it gives you a small advantage if you can demonstrate that your solution works with a small test. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#e10f08ab-cbe5-4e7a-8f19-e9a96f6b5102)  ^e10f08ab

> If you run out of time, or hit a problem you can't fix, you should describe what you would do next before the interview ends. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#ca081eb4-3a54-44be-be9a-a7f355df3803)  ^ca081eb4

> Specific Interview Advice: Design [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#6fac0cf7-46f7-43b4-853d-9bbb80828d30)  ^6fac0cf7

> These interviews are intentionally vague. You need to start by asking questions to clarify the requirements [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#6260da51-2ebf-4c93-8a2b-b61cad8969d3)  ^6260da51

> Describe the system from the big picture, down to the details, rather than the opposite. I recommend starting with a high-level block diagram, a description of how a user will using the system, or an API. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#97345278-272b-4f19-b5a0-26fe39247f08)  ^97345278

> Draw a diagram, and use it while talking. It does not need to be detailed, but you should have one box with a label for every important component. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#1613d765-0300-4fd8-a8d6-68ba60c7fdc8)  ^1613d765

> Say when you don't know something, but demonstrate that you can make reasonable assumptions. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#766ad2c5-f994-4594-afd7-5f8b57dded78)  ^766ad2c5

> For example, I don't really know anything about training a machine learning system. If I were asked a question about it, I would say "I don't know how machine learning algorithms work, but I know we need to provide them lots of training data. Can I assume I have a library that I will call with a single example, and it will return success or failure when it is done training?" [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#07b8526f-06b0-41a3-b53a-29d03cea3bbf)  ^07b8526f

> Don't say anything you aren't willing to talk about in more detail. If you do need to mention something you aren't totally sure about, say it. It is much better to say something like "I think I might be getting this wrong, but I think this might be called idempotent", then to say "this is idempotent" and be wrong [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#5b4faada-c865-46a8-8353-00abdb91d9ed)  ^5b4faada

> Name specific technologies as examples of what you would use, to demonstrate that you know about them, and to make your design more concrete. For example, if you need a database, don't just say "we should use a database." It is better to say "we should use a relational database, maybe Postgres." [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#7ae61124-c516-42f5-8559-afaf0e40092d)  ^7ae61124

> Briefly explain why you want to do things in a certain way. For example, "we should have a separate search service and a upload service" is okay, but "we should have a separate search service and upload service because I think they will have performance requirements" is better. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#16000965-9b72-4cbd-9732-1e8bcd0ebeb6)  ^16000965

> Design: If you realize you made a mistake, or want to change something you previously mentioned, explicitly point it out. It is a good thing to re-evaluate previous decisions as you explore the design. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#c15e4d23-714d-4653-bb1e-3ce81ddea46a)  ^c15e4d23

> Do a back of the envelope estimate, if a good example comes up. If you can show your thinking numerically, it is a lot more convincing than vague statements like "that sounds large" [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#1a3e04f6-6acc-4346-a749-14909189b201)  ^1a3e04f6

> Hint about your areas of strength. While you are describing a component, if you could describe it in great detail, you should drop a hint. This lets your interviewer ask about it, if they are interested. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/advice-on-looking-for-a-new-software-engineering-job-evanjones-c-185d8ab364d#9a1bed71-61f9-4fd0-9dee-49c157d59716)  ^9a1bed71
